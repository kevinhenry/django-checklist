3. poetry init -n (this initializes a new directory)
4. peotry add django
5. poetry shell
6. django-admin startproject name-of-project . (make sure to add the period at the end)
7. code .
8. python manage.py runserver (starts the backend server... you'll probably see some migration errors. use control + C to stop server)
9. python manage.py migrate (with server closed)
10. python manage.py startapp app_name (creates a new application)
The rest of the order doesn't really matter but needs to get done (add app, update views, urls and templates)

13. from django.vies.generic import TemplateView
14. create a class for each html webpage that you want to render.
class HomePageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'home.html'
Update URLs (both in application and main project foler)
15. create a urls.py inside of application folder. Either use vscode or 'touch urls.py' in terminal
16. imports inside urls.py: from django.urls import path, from .views import HomePageView & AboutPageView (these are the templates)
17. create a urlpatterns = [
path('', HomePageView.as_view(), name = 'home'),
path('about', AboutPageView.as_view(), name = 'about'),
]
18. add another path inside the urls.py inside of the project folder. urlpatterns = [path ('', include('app_name.url')),]
